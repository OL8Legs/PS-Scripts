## Lessons

> I learned a lot while making this script as it is my first PS script ever. My one major roadblocks was getting the script to write to the columns in the csv 
> properly, that was because I didn't know how to call the headers properly and I didn't know how to use Export-Csv properly. The Rename-Computer cmdlet is very simple 
> as long as you put in all the right arguments.
